Hi guys,

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:09.970
this is Max Tapper again from HowCast, and what we're gonna go through today is how to do a push up.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.699
The reason we have to do this is because many people do it wrong.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.189
So let me show you how it looks.

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:19.739
What I'll do first is show you the common mistakes that people do and one is gonna be sinking their

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.959
back into the floor.

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:21.520
All right.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.840
So a lot of people will allow their self to sink down in their push up and end up here.

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:28.209
All right.

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:29.069
That's not right.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.030
We need your body to be straight like a plank.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.430
OK?

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.150
So leg straight out body level,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.189
we're gonna bring our chest down to the floor.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.619
And up,

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:43.560
slow and controlled, and up. In no position is my body ever gonna sink.

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.919
OK.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.060
So this is the way to do a proper push up.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.009
Now,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.069
if you don't have enough upper body strength to do that with your leg straight,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.080
you can put your knees down and that'll look like this.

00:01:04.528 --> 00:01:05.119
Ok?

00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:05.668
Now,

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:10.569
that altered type of push up is an awesome way for you to build up strength to then do the straight out push up.

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:13.388
there's many different applications to throw push ups in.

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.388
You could be on vacation to get a good workout.

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.079
You could be in the gym to get a good workout no matter what,

00:01:18.088 --> 00:01:21.308
you have to do it correctly and make sure you don't injure yourself.

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.958
All right guys.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.018
So get out there and be safe.
